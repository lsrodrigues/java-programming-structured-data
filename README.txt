Hi everybody

This course will build on the skills you learn in Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software. 
You will learn to read and manipulate data with more complex structure. 
You will also write programs with more complex structure.

What's covered in the course:
1. Read and write data from/to files; 
2. Solve problems involving data files;
3. Perform quantitative analyses of data (e.g., finding maximums, minimums, averages); 
4. Store and manipulate data in an array or ArrayList; 
5. Combine multiple classes to solve larger problems; 
6. Use iterables and collections (including maps) in Java.
